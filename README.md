# Reinforcement Learning Agent
This is a public project, use whatever part of it intrigues you. I'm just learning about reinforcement learning and tried out an idea to use stock market data for it.

## Disclaimer
If you have stumbled upon this repository in hopes of gaining insight on coding a reinforcement agent, don't look at this code. It's been generated using ChatGPT so I can get a base outline of classes and methods. I haven't gone through it yet to make it work or customize at all. The market_data and enums are working (I just lazily copied them over from another project), it's not pretty and I still need to go through and remove a lot of the extra validation stuff that I put in before switching to using Enums. 

Cheers!
